SimCity 2000 for DOS/Windows Cheat  v2.0  by Ronald Mendoza

This little cheat will modify any SimCity 2000 city to have over $2 billion
dollars.  This is better than importing in a cheated city from SimCity
Classic, since those will not have any mountains, etc.

This is an update to my previous cheat.  It should now work on cities created
with either the DOS or Windows versions of the game.  Again, I must stress
that you MAKE A BACKUP of your city, because there is always the possibility
that the cheat may not work.  This may be done with the following command:

COPY ________.sc2 *.bak

To use this cheat, you should first of all have it in your SimCity 2000
directory.  (\SC2000 or \SC2K4WIN)  Then, at the DOS prompt, you would type
the following:

SC2KCHT2 ________.sc2    (Fill in the blank with your city filename)

Example:
 I have a city with the city name of Beavisville, and the filename of
 BEAVISVI.SC2 that I want to cheat.  First, I would make a backup copy of it
 with the command:

 COPY BEAVISVI.SC2 *.BAK

 Then, I would cheat it with the command:

 SC2KCHT2 BEAVISVI.SC2

 Finally, I would restart SimCity 2000 and re-load my city.

=============================================================================
I will not be held responsible for any possible damage to your cities done by
this cheat.  By using this cheat, you understand and agree to abide.
